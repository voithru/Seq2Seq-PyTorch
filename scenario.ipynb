      "\n",
      "Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square, Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced. Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, \"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't believe justice was done,\" Weinberg said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long \"pattern of violence\" involving firearms.  Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict »\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was not an isolated incident,\" Fidler said, noting Spector's two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s. \"The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating 15 days, jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector \"a very dangerous man\" who \"has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do pointed out, however, to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done, the prosecutor said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This entire jury took this so seriously,\" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that \"it's tough to be in a jury,\" because another person's life is in the jury's hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie \"Barbarian Queen\" and appeared in many other films, including \"DeathStalker,\" \"Blind Date,\" \"Scarface,\" \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" and the spoof \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home.\n",
      "\n",
      "But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Spector's retrial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spector's professional trademark was the \"Wall of Sound,\" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict?\n",
      "\n",
      "The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called \"little symphonies for the kids\" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.\"\n",

      "Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, \"Let It Be,\" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up.

      "(CNN) -- The eurozone crisis has truly engulfed Italy -- but is it because the country is insolvent or simply unable to access funds easily in the financial markets?\n",
      "\n",
      "If Italy is solvent, a distinction can perhaps be drawn between it and the countries surviving on bailout funds from Europe and the International Monetary Fund -- Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The solution, in this case, would be for the European Central Bank to provide cheap liquidity -- loans, effectively -- to the Italian government for a limited period of time. The markets would then be pacified and the crisis would begin to be resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only it were that easy. The distinction between being insolvent and unable to access funds easily in the financial markets might be natural to enterprises but it does not easily fit sovereign states. Italy is certainly finding it difficult to access funds -- the bond markets are gradually turning the tap off by pushing rates on ten year bonds above 7%. But how can we tell if it is insolvent?\n",
      "\n",
      "Solvency means that Italy could be reliably expected to service its national debt out of its expanding gross domestic product (GDP). If lenders were confident about growth and sufficient tax revenues, they would continue to meet Italy's public borrowing needs. If they were not, the country would have a liquidity problem, as is currently happening. Solvency and liquidity are closely connected for sovereign states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial markets rightly worry about Italy's solvency. They have often been wrong during the last several years, but not this time. Since the mid-1990s, Italian growth has been less than 2% a year; investment and consumption have been practically flat; increases in people's real income have been among the weakest in Europe, worse even than Germany. Italian households, traditionally conservative, have increased their borrowing to 45% of GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only one word can characterize Italian performance during the years of monetary union: stagnation. The country has systematically lost competitiveness relative to Germany. The result has been one of the highest national debts in Europe, standing at around 120% of GDP. Critically, as Italian households have come under pressure, national saving has been steadily declining, making it difficult for the country to service its national debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenders are justifiably worried since, in all these respects, Italy looks similar to the struggling smaller economies of the eurozone periphery. It might be a sizeable economy with a large industrial base, but that means little in this case. The European Monetary Union -- which is the system within which the euro operates -- has trapped several countries of diverging competitiveness within a rigid framework of fixed exchange rates, a single monetary policy, tough fiscal discipline, and continuous pressure on labor. The markets realize that Italy's debt predicament is similar to peripheral countries, and are sensing that the crisis is gradually moving to the core.\n",
      "\n",
      "The response of the European Union has been a testament to its weakness. To placate markets it has demanded the imposition of austerity on Italy. But the economics of austerity makes no sense at all. Italian problems have originated in a stagnant economy, not in a profligate state. Austerity would almost certainly make things worse by pushing the country into recession, thus worsening the burden of debt. Greece is an extreme case, but it shows graphically the dangers. Italy is entering a risky path -- and the markets know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, the imposition of austerity has directly transgressed on Italian sovereignty and on the domestic democratic process, as it has done elsewhere in the periphery. The EU appears to be increasingly run by a small cabal of core countries which impose decisions on others, ignore national institutions and practices, and even force elected governments out of office in preference to so-called non-political administrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the liquidity crisis gets sharper and Italy threatens to be shut out of the markets, the EU has only one weapon in its armory: the European Central Bank . It must stem the unfolding collapse of the monetary union by allowing the ECB to buy large volumes of Italian debt. But this could only fix the shortage of liquidity -- Italy's solvency problem will continue and probably become worse through austerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, moreover, the ECB started freely to purchase the public debt of the other 16 countries, it would soil its own balance sheet, a dangerous course to adopt as there is no state to back it up. The credibility of the euro would suffer across the world, defeating the purpose of the monetary union for Germany and other countries at the core.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Italy in turmoil, the EMU is coming up against its own contradictions and probably heading for a breakup. The mix of economic malfunctioning and open disregard for national sovereignty and democracy is highly combustible. Peripheral countries, in particular, are steadily forced toward the exit, with Greece under the most intense pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably the only way to break out of the trap of monetary union, while restoring sovereignty and reasserting democracy. Should that occur, the implications for the European and the global economy will be very severe. But those who decide EU policy would have only themselves to blame.\n",

      "(Health.com) -- For Marika Holmgren, fighting breast cancer was an uphill battle -- literally. She got back on her mountain bike shortly after her diagnosis in February 2007, smack-dab in the middle of chemotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The treatment is so intense -- it strips everything away. You're physically and completely changed,\" says Holmgren, 40. \"I was trying to retain some sense of normalcy. And truthfully, I felt a little badass being on my bike during treatment. I was giving cancer the middle finger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Health.com: My Breast Cancer Diary in Pictures\n",
      "\n",
      "Tooling around on a mountain bike during chemotherapy sounds intense, maybe even unadvisable. But just the opposite is true: Holmgren was being a model patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, doctors often told cancer patients to take it easy during treatment. Although the appropriate amount of exercise varies from patient to patient, that conventional wisdom is now considered old hat. In fact, new guidelines on cancer and exercise from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) urge cancer patients to be as physically active as possible both during and after their treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea that you should be staying put and resting is ultimately doing more harm than good,\" says Kathryn Schmitz, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, in Philadelphia. Schmitz, who studies the role of physical activity in chronic diseases, presented the guidelines at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting last week.\n",

      "\n",
      "Still, experts now say that exercise may help with -- not add to -- those problems. It boosts energy, helps stave off the weight gain often associated with treatment, and provides a psychological pick-me-up at a time when a person's morale is likely to be battered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even small amounts help\n",
      "\n",
      "How much exercise is enough? The ACSM recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, which works out to about 20 minutes a day -- the same amount recommended to the general public.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the organization is realistic about how cancer and its treatment can alter mood and energy levels. Any kind of activity -- even a short walk -- is better than none, the ACSM says.\n",

      "\"The risk of inactivity for cancer patients is so great that it's best to just get started with something,\" says Schmitz. If you begin to feel worse or overtired, Schmitz recommends discussing it with your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who were sedentary before their diagnosis should start by walking for 10 minutes each day, says Schmitz, and gradually increase their time by 10 percent to 15 percent each week until they can do 30 minutes at a stretch, five times per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "There may be days when you feel nauseous, exhausted, or utterly despondent. But friends or family can help. \"A lot of it will be up to the caregivers, because they are the ones who will know how to motivate patients facing an uphill battle,\" says Schmitz. \"They're the ones who can say, 'Hey, let's get dressed today,' and then, 'Hey, let's get dressed and walk around the house.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to pick an activity you enjoy, says Alyson Moadel, Ph.D., the director of the psychosocial oncology program at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center, in the Bronx, New York. \"It is not a one-size-fits-all answer, since patients may be more responsive and adherent to different fitness programs,\" she says. \"It's important to allow patients a choice and to tailor a fitness program to each patient.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately the options are greater than ever before, as exercise programs for cancer patients have become increasingly popular nationwide. In 2007 the Lance Armstrong Foundation partnered with the YMCA to provide physical activities designed specifically for survivors, and more and more hospitals are creating their own programs as well. Cancer patients who aren't willing or able to travel to a facility on a regular basis can sign up for programs that can be delivered by mail, phone, or the Internet.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I had no hair, no eyelashes, and no eyebrows, and yet I didn't think they would know I had cancer,\" says Holmgren. \"The women were so fun and inspiring, and they never babied me. They just let me do my thing at my own pace.\"\n",

      "How exercise helps\n",
      "\n",
      "Dozens of studies have demonstrated the benefits of staying active both during and after treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular exercise can help fight the weight gain that often comes with cancer treatment, including breast cancer. \"It's about what the typical American could expect to gain over the course of a couple of years, but it's happening all at once,\" says Schmitz.\n",
      "\n",
      "But exercise is also important for cancer patients whose treatment can cause them to lose weight. Prostate cancer, cancers of the stomach and gut, and head and neck cancers can all lead to a significant decrease in muscle mass, as well as a loss of taste and an inability to process certain foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those patients really need to focus on resistance exercises,\" says Schmitz. \"That will help them increase their muscle mass and gain that functional tissue that they need.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though most patients won't be able to accomplish the same physical feats they were capable of before their diagnoses, adds Schmitz, staying active helps them achieve \"a whole lot more than they would have been able to if they hadn't been exercising.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Health.com: Fit at Any Age: Your 50s Strength Workout\n",
      "\n",
      "Exercising has more intangible benefits as well. In a 2007 study that followed advanced cancer patients who exercised while undergoing chemo, the participants were asked to keep diaries. Many of them noted the positive mental aspects of exercise. \"It feels good to have a sense of an everyday life again,\" wrote one participant. \"I have become incredibly energetic,\" wrote another.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to making patients feel normal again, staying active is a way for patients to measure the progress of their recovery. Holmgren stuck with her rides all summer while undergoing chemo. \"They became a real benchmark for me,\" she says. \"The more I would ride, the more I felt like I was getting back to my old self.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Holmgren still can't match some of the climbs she conquered pre-diagnosis, mountain biking has helped her make peace with her changed body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The hormone treatment, early menopause, early arthritis, the weight gain, the surgeries -- breast cancer takes a huge toll on your body,\" she says. \"I knew I was going to feel bad no matter what, so I figured I might as well be feeling bad on my bike doing something that I used to do -- and something that people not going through cancer might not be able to do.\"\n",

      "But there are a few apps that have no intention of ushering you somewhere quickly. Instead, they want to help you get out, get moving and get a little lost, hopefully discovering something new along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the idea behind an application called Dérive, which was developed by Eduardo Cachucho, an architect and lecturer based in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set up like a loosely structured game, Dérive consists of a general set of instructional cards that can be used anywhere or localized versions for select cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "They prompt the user to set out in a generalized direction, offering cryptic hints to help them along. For example, you might be instructed to \"turn left and search for something sweet,\" and then to \"keep going straight and look for a sign of hope.\"\n",

Cachucho said that one of the first reactions some people have is questioning how someone can truly appreciate the world around them with their eyes on a phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think there's a misconception that you can't interface with the two at the same time,\" he said. \"It's really based on the idea that if you give a person the tools to explore the urban space, given the right cues, it'll get someone to move in an interesting direction.\"\n",

      "\n",

      "(CNN) -- One of the key questions asked after any serious airline incident is, how do we stop this happening again?\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaysia Airlines has changed its cockpit regulations as a result of Flight 370's disappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many other incidents in the past have led to safer flying conditions for us today, as a result of improvements and changes to protocol, laws and technology in planes. Below we outline some of the most important ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "These helped pave the way to making 2013 one of the safest years in aviation history according to the Aviation Safety Network, with only 29 known accidents worldwide and 265 fatalities (the 10-year average is 720 fatalities per year).\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Collision Avoidance Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "Collision Avoidance Systems have been a priority in the aerospace industry since the inception of flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1956, a TWA jet crashed into a United Airlines flight above the Grand Canyon. The incident was the first of many that illustrated the need for increased communication between planes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years later, the Federal Aviation Administration was formed to set guidelines for aviation in the United States, but still, issues remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other two-plane accidents -- including a 1996 collision near New Delhi that resulted in 349 casualties -- emphasized the need for advanced anti-collision technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a congressional ruling in 1991, the FAA implemented the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, which monitors the airspace around an aircraft independent of air traffic control.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"TCAS really came about in the late '90s, and since then, I don't think we've really seen a collision between two airlines,\" noted Phil Seymour, president and COO of the International Bureau of Aviation, a consultancy that offers analysis and advice to the aviation industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the world's safest airline is ...\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Roomier seats\n",
      "\n",
      "Coach may seem pretty crammed these days, but according to Seymour, there's a limit to how much plane manufacturers are allowed to shave off the space around seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, modern-day seat layout has been rigorously calculated to carry out the most effective evacuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is in part thanks to research carried out by the Cranfield Institute after a 1985 incident when a British Airtours 737 caught fire before takeoff at Manchester International Airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "An engine caught fire, and the flames spread quickly. Unfortunately, the lack of space between seats meant that bottle-necking occurred at the doors, and some passengers couldn't escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The aisles became jammed with people panicking to exit, and there literally wasn't enough space between the seats,\" Seymour recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, there are limits in terms of the minimum space between seats as well as the distance to an emergency exit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Weather radar\n",
      "\n",
      "Severe weather has played a role in some crashes, most notably that of Delta Airlines Flight 191, which crashed in 1985 while approaching Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in a thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rain is one thing, but if a pilot gets into wind shear and the currents are there, it will literally just push your aircraft onto the ground. There have been some incidents where aircraft have crashed when making their final approach,\" Seymour said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1981, the FAA required all turbine-powered commercial planes be installed with wind shear detection systems by 1993. Since then, the models have become increasingly sophisticated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A lot of the more advanced weather radar don't just detect bad weather but predict wind shear. If a pilot sees wind shear coming, instead of landing, he can circle around the airport until it disappears.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Language of air travel: How traffic control keeps you safe\n",

      "4. Manual training\n",
      "\n",
      "It took two years for search parties to recover the black box from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean en route to Paris from Rio.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reviewing the recordings, the French Bureau d'EnquÃªtes et d'Analyse blamed pilot error, in particular an overdependence on the automated flight control system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The senior captain was on his break, and the aircraft was being piloted by two less experienced pilots,\" recalled Seymour. \"Since then, Airbus and Boeing have both changed their operation procedures and have put more focus on manual training.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of the incident, Air France also revamped its training procedures and introduced a \"gatekeeper\" position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gatekeepers are tasked with contacting the flight crew in the event of an incident and providing pilots with on-the-spot training, tools and advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Retiring old planes\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAA addressed the issue of how long planes should fly in 1988 when it created the National Aging Aircraft Research program, which monitors the structural integrity of older planes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The measure was a result of an Aloha Airlines accident. While flying at 24,000 feet, a large section of the roof blew off, leaving passengers flying in the open air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plane -- a Boeing 737 -- was 19 years old, and investigators blamed the incident on the plane's age-related wear and tear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Air New Zealand's new swimsuit safety video: Fun or offensive?\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Reviewing repairs\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to making repairs to old aircraft, airlines have also become increasingly stringent.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is mainly the result of Japan Airlines Flight 123, which crashed in the mountains 62 miles from Tokyo. The crash was the result of a poorly executed repair made several years earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The repair covered a crack in the bulkhead, but many hundreds of flights later, it corroded, and the air pressure bulkhead just burst open,\" recalled Seymour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boeing responded by monitoring its repairs more closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After that, the types of repairs allowed on an aircraft skin were much more rigorously controlled,\" Seymour said.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Retrieving data\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the Air France 447 crash and the more recent incident involving Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have spotlighted the need for better access to data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There were several recommendations stemming from AF447, mainly centered around the flight data recorders and, more specifically, on ensuring the ability to locate them more easily and quickly,\" said Ilias Maragakis, communications officer for the European Aviation Safety Agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the aftermath of the Air France incident, the agency published a notice of a proposed amendment to retire older recording technologies and recommended that cockpit voice recorders have a minimum recording duration of two hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it may be a while before the necessary changes are implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Changes to regulations do take time. It's taken almost two decades for aircraft to be manufactured and older aircraft to be modified to have a system that means an empty fuel tank can't explode on an aircraft,\" Seymour pointed out.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court dealt federal prosecutors dual setbacks Monday in efforts to prosecute the laundering of drug ring and organized crime profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Supreme Court considered a pair of cases involving hidden money and an illegal gambling ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The justices ruled that merely hiding money headed out of the United States is not proof of money laundering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justices also concluded that prosecutors had to prove that an illegal gambling ring had laundered profits of its betting, rather than just proceeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a unanimous ruling, the justices overturned the federal conviction of Humberto Regaldo Cuellar, who had run afoul of the \"transportation\" part of the international money-laundering law when his car was stopped by a deputy sheriff near Eldorado, Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the car, officers found nearly $81,000 in cash wrapped in duct-taped bundles and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair, presumably to trick drug-sniffing dogs. Police suspected the money came from drug trafficking and arrested Cuellar, who had been heading for Mexico when he was stopped. Cuellar was convicted and sentenced to 78 months in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal law requires proof the transportation was \"designed to conceal or disguise the nature, location, the source, the ownership, or the control\" of the money. Writing for the high court, Justice Clarence Thomas said prosecutors failed to prove the reason for moving the money across the border was to hide its source, as part of an alleged international drug ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Although the evidence suggested Cuellar's  transportation would have the effect of concealing funds, the evidence did not demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the transportation \" Thomas wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress passed a law in 1986 designed to prevent the laundering, or \"washing,\" of criminal funds through legitimate enterprises and overseas bank accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the other case, the high court split 5-4 in concluding that prosecutors failed to show money used to pay couriers in alleged gambling operation were \"profits,\" rather than \"gross proceeds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The case involved Efrain Santos and Benedicto Diaz, convicted of running an illegal lottery in Indiana since the 1970s. Santos allegedly used a network of \"runners\" and \"collectors\" to run the enterprise, and Diaz was a collector who gathered money from the runners and delivered it to Santos.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The money laundering charges brought against Santos were based on his payments to the lottery winners and his employees, and the money laundering charge brought against Diaz was based on his receipt of payments as an employer,\" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a very narrow opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither type of transaction can fairly be characterized as involving the lottery's profits,\" Scalia added. \"Indeed, the government did not try to prove, and the defendants have not admitted, that they laundered criminal profits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalia noted the high court's ruling would not overly burden prosecutors, saying only one instance of \"profitability\" would be required to prove money laundering. \"What counts is whether the receipts from the charged unlawful act exceeded the costs fairly attributable to it,\" he said, adding the government \"exaggerates\" the difficulty it would have to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Scalia wrote the main ruling, it was Justice John Paul Stevens who provided the critical fifth vote for a majority, and his concurring views will probably provide the controlling opinion to guide lower courts in similar cases down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stevens did not go as far as Scalia wanted, saying Congress failed by writing an \"ambiguous\" law that only confused judges. He said lawmakers seemed to want a broader interpretation of \"proceeds\" as the term applied to money laundering.\n",

      "Of course, Pee-wee became a major star once he hit the big screen with 1985's Tim Burton-directed \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure.\" The success of that bizarre comedy helped Reubens launch a TV series, the eventual cult-classic \"Pee-wee's Playhouse,\" in 1986.

      "\n",
      "The Pope stressed that there was no justification for the killing of 17 people in three separate incidents, including a massacre in and around the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The assailants were reportedly Islamist extremists, some of whom called out \"Allahu akbar,\" which is Arabic for \"God is great,\" as they singled out the magazine, French authorities and Jewish people.\n",

      "Still, even as he decried the violence and generally spoke in support of freedom of expression, the pontiff said that such freedom must have its limits.\n",

      "He didn't mention Charlie Hebdo specifically, or its cartoon depictions of Mohammed, something that many Muslims find offensive.

Vatican spokesman Thomas Rosica later told CNN the remark was \"spoken colloquially,\" adding the Pope wasn't advocating violence or in any way justifying the terror attacks.\n",

      "\n",
      "The suspect, Arid Uka, is a recently radicalized Muslim who seems to have been influenced by local radical Islamist websites, according to German authorities. Prosecutors say Uka shot and killed two U.S. servicemen and wounded two others in the attack Wednesday on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrest warrant for Uka lists two accusations of murder, three allegations of attempted murder and two accusations of causing severe bodily harm.\n",

      "The 21-year-old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before, which he claimed showed U.S. soldiers raping Muslim women, according to a German intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect's interrogation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect confessed to the shooting, and said that he acted alone with no helpers, the German intelligence official said Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was friends on Facebook with several pro-al Qaeda extremists from a group based in Bonn, Germany, that is known to German intelligence officials, according to the official. He also had links to an Islamist preacher named Pierre Vogel and someone named Nessery, who was arrested about two months ago in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gunman was a postal worker at the airport, but worked outside the secure area. The U.S. official said Uka didn't appear to punch into work Wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand, helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain-clothes security that typically patrol the Frankfurt airport.\n",

      "He has passports from both Germany and Yugoslavia, the latter of which was issued prior to Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, Rexhepi said.\n",

      "Uka told interrogators that he lived with his family in high-rise public housing in a poor area of Frankfurt, the German intelligence official said. He said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there. He said his father was very strict and harsh with him, according to the official.\n",

      "On Wednesday, he allegedly approached a bus, which was parked outside Terminal 2 and was clearly marked as a U.S. military vehicle, German police said after the shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the warrant, Uka asked a recruit where he was being deployed. The airman replied that he and his comrades were headed to Afghanistan. Uka then shot him in the back of the head with a handgun. The suspect then entered the bus, screamed \"Alahu Akbar,\" and opened fire, killing the driver, the warrant says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uka then shot two other passengers, wounding one in the head and the other in the chest, the warrant says. The suspect tried to shoot another serviceman but his gun jammed, it says.\n",

      "Beijing, China (CNN) -- The Chinese public, especially those in the social networking community, are abuzz over the case of a man charged with killing a girl in a hit-and-run: He is the son of a local deputy police chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Li Qiming, 23, is accused of \"perpetration of traffic accident,\" a charge punishable by three to seven years in prison. During the two-and-a-half hour trial Wednesday in the northern city of Baoding, Li admitted causing the death of Chen Xiaofeng, 20, according to Chinese media reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's more than just a tragic traffic accident. \"There is a lot of popular anger about 'guan er dai,' the children of officials who sometimes literally get away with murder,\" says Jeremy Goldkorn, founding editor-in-chief of Danwei, a China media website. He said the online uproar is focused on \"how likely it is that Li Qiming will get away with a light sentence, and whether blood money will secure his freedom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Official media have reported that Li was drunk when he ran over two female students on the Hebei University campus, killing Chen and injuring fellow student Zhang Jingjing. Li allegedly tried to speed away from the scene. It was also reported that, when students and campus security guards stopped him, he shouted at the guards, \"My daddy is Li Gang\" -- referring to a local deputy police chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "When indignant Chinese Internet users got wind of the story, they blogged and reposted it widely. Before long, \"My-daddy-is-Li-Gang\" went viral. \"It spread on the Internet -- on blogs, forum websites and the Twitter-like microblog service Weibo,\" recalls Goldkorn, a long-time observer of China's social networking sites. \"The public expressed outrage on the Internet, and the traditional news media and the government reacted to the Internet coverage of the event.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the government's efforts to contain the fallout, the incident drew widespread criticism among China's estimated 420 million Internet users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My daddy is Li Gang\" became one of the top search items on most popular Chinese search engines, a viral catchphrase synonymous to abuse of power. Some composed sarcastic poems and songs. Others parodied the father-son duo in videos posted in cyberspace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case became a cause célèbre among Internet users who viewed it as an example of official abuse. It also put the spotlight on the growing gap between the rich and the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Lin, the victim's 23-year-old brother, complained: \"In society they say everyone is equal, but in every corner there is inequality. How can you live in this country and this society without any worry? I feel like there should be deep reflection on this. This is the reality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing resident Yang Ning, a white-collar worker, agrees. \"The case is symbolic,\" he tells me. \"In China it's all about who your father is. Without a good father, you already lose at the starting line. Without a good father, you have to work 10 times harder than those born with good fathers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chinese authorities have tried to assuage the public ire. Days after the accident, the China Central Television showed Li under police detention, profusely apologizing and expressing remorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father Li Gang also appeared in a nationally broadcast TV interview, breaking down and bowing deeply to apologize to the victim's family. \"As for my child's education, as a father I failed,\" he cried. \"I am very sad, very guilty, very ashamed.\" He promised not to shield his son from the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November, according to Chinese media reports, Li Gang reached a civil settlement with the victim's families, agreeing to pay 460,000 yuan (US$67,700) in restitution for the Chen family and 92,000 yuan (US$14,000) to Zhang's family. He did not attend Wednesday's court hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The victim's brother Chen Lin attended. \"My family and I want justice,\" he was quoted by the Chinese media as saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state prosecutor asked for a three-to-seven year prison sentence for Li, according to the Xinhua News Agency, while the defendant's lawyer called for leniency, noting that he has expressed remorse and compensated the victims' families.\n",

      "It is not known how soon the court will render its sentence.\n",

      "(CNN) -- The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan has a unique résumé: he served two tours in the country as a general, training Afghan police and troops, before trading his uniform for a diplomat's business suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "His career history may give Karl Eikenberry's word particular weight as President Obama struggles to come up with a way forward in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eikenberry sent private cables to Obama last week, urging the president not to rush to send more troops to Afghanistan -- although the top U.S. military commander there, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, wants 40,000 more pairs of boots on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial reports about the cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over President Hamid Karzai's government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Eikenberry nor the White House would comment on the contents of private advice between the envoy and the president, but the reports alarmed Karzai enough that his office sought confirmation from the U.S. Embassy about them, a Karzai spokesman told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karzai's office did not get the information it sought, the spokesman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever Eikenberry told the president, the ambassador is unusually well versed in the military problems facing Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "He retired from the Army after nearly 40 years of service with the rank of lieutenant general on April 28 -- one day before he was sworn in as ambassador, according to his State Department biography.\n",
      "\n",
      "His long military career included time in Kabul as U.S. security coordinator and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Afghanistan has been at the center of my career since 9/11, when the terrorist-commandeered aircraft crashed into the Pentagon just below the office in which I was working,\" Eikenberry said at his Senate confirmation hearing in March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no silver bullet and no quick, cheap or easy solutions. There is no substitute for more resources and sacrifice,\" he said then.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he added: \"There is no exclusively military solution to the issues we and our partners confront in Afghanistan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He also advised the U.S. secretary of defense on China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mongolia, and was deputy director for strategy, plans and policy on the Army staff.\n",

      "\n",
      "Adam Foster, 30, of Burdett, New York, was taken into custody at the conclusion of the hearing in Dubai to begin serving his sentence, his lawyer, Yousuf Khalifa Hammad, told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster had been detained for more than two months in the UAE on charges of stealing police handcuffs, an allegation he vehemently denied and said he only confessed to after being tortured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't say he was happy. But he didn't show any (anger). He accepted the judgment,\" Hammad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge's ruling brings to an end a case that was the focal point of a grassroots writing campaign organized via Facebook. Nearly 2,000 people wrote letters to the UAE's ambassador to the United States on Foster's behalf, demanding his release.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks to everyone that who has supported me during all of this,\" Foster wrote in a brief message late Wednesday on Facebook. \"I can't stress enough how much that means to me. Court is in less than 12 hours.. not going to get much sleep tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster faced up to seven years in prison on charges of theft of government property, possession of police paraphernalia and theft at night. Officials in the UAE did not responded to multiple requests by CNN for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster has been given credit for four days served during his initial detention and could have an additional seven days shaved off his sentence for good behavior, Hammad said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. State Department has confirmed that Foster has been detained since February 26. American consular officers met him on February 28 before UAE authorities released him on bail March 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigators claim Foster stole a pair of official police handcuffs during questioning in an unrelated matter at a Dubai police station the night before he was due to leave the city, according to his attorney, Hammad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster has said it was a coincidence, saying he was brought in for questioning because he was in possession of a bottle of Korean rice wine -- a parting gift from colleagues. He was released without charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster said he found the handcuffs a day earlier on the ground at a mall parking lot, about a mile and half from the police station where he was questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was thinking 'souvenir,'\" Foster told CNN last week. \"They were lying on the ground. So I picked them up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster, who was on his way home after a six-week stint as a contractor for Dubai Energy Water Authority, was arrested after authorities found the handcuffs in his luggage during a routine security screening at the Dubai airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "After hours of maintaining his innocence during police questioning, he was beaten and forced to confess, Foster said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He claims he was told to take off his shoes and socks, and handcuffed to a chair while one of two officers used a coil to whip the bottom of his feet. He also said he was punched in the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster said he then signed a confession written in Arabic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster said he recanted his confession after he was released from jail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 2,000 people appealed to Yousef al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, and Jeffrey D. Feltman of the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to intervene on Foster's behalf.\n",
